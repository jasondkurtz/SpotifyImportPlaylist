# For this to work properly, you will need to create an application at https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/applications

#From there, you will need to set only one setting within your app for this to work.

# Set Redirect URIs to http://localhost:8888/callback/
#  - This just sets the redirect URI to your local machine, when you first run the python script it will ask you to authenticate your account if you've done everything correct!
